### Introduction
Modeling the establishment and spread of pathogens, which cause and carry infectious diseases, is a cornerstone of disease ecology and epidemiology. The simplest, yet still very effective, approach to modeling disease transmission is to separate a population into compartments that represent the health status of portions of the population. Perhaps the most popular *compartmental model* is the **SIR** model that divides the focal population into three compartments: **S**usceptible, **I**nfected, and **R**ecovered ([see here for Wikipedia description](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model)).

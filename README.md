# EcoEvoApps
Shiny applications for models in ecology and evolution. For the list and links to interactive models, visit our project website http://ecoevoeducation.github.io/EcoEvoApps/.

## Contributing
### Request a model
If there is a model you would like to see on our site, create a GitHub [issue](http://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). If time allows, we'll try to get your request up and running.

### Develop your own Shiny app
If you would like to add to our list of available models with your own app, we ask that you do a couple things:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) our repository
2. Check out our file structure and vignette style
3. Create your own Shiny module
4. Test the vignette (.Rmd file) on your computer
5. Create a [pull request](http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

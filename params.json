  "body": "### Welcome\r\nMany of the foundational theories in ecology are based on mathematical models, and learning these concepts is a necessary part of understanding ecology. \r\n\r\nHowever, starting out in ecological and evolutionary theory is difficult. Students not only have to think conceptually and mathematically, but they often need to learn how to code as well. \r\n\r\nHere at EcoEvoEdu we want to make learning ecological theory easier using shiny modules and informative webpages.\r\n\r\nBelow we have developed pages that describe basic ecological theory and that include R code. We expect that these models can be used for independent ecologists refreshing their memories, or can be used as part of a course for upper-level undergraduates and/or graduate students. \r\n\r\n### Modules\r\n* Exponential growth: https://atredennick.shinyapps.io/PopulationGrowth/\r\n* Logistic growth: http://ecoevoedu.shinyapps.io/LogisticGrowth\r\n* Structured growth: https://brittzinator.shinyapps.io/StructuredGrowth/StructuredGrowth.Rmd\r\n* Competitive interactions (Lotka-Volterra): http://ecoevoedu.shinyapps.io/LotkaVolterra\r\n* Coexistence via the storage effect: http://ecoevoedu.shinyapps.io/StorageEffect\r\n* Disease transmission model: http://ecoevoedu.shinyapps.io/SIRmodel\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBrittany Teller (@brittzinator)\r\n\r\nAndrew Tredennick (@atredennick)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Funding and Disclaimer\r\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1400370 to Andrew Tredennick and Grant Number 1353078 to Peter Adler.
